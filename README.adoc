= Spring Fu

Spring Fu is an incubator for new Spring features related to functional configuration and runtime efficiency.

Instead of using JavaConfig and auto-configuration, it provides an explicit way of configuring Spring Boot applications
with a https://repo.spring.io/snapshot/org/springframework/fu/spring-fu-kofu/0.0.3.BUILD-SNAPSHOT/spring-fu-kofu-0.0.3.BUILD-SNAPSHOT-javadoc.jar!/kofu/org.springframework.fu.kofu/application.html[Kotlin DSL (Kofu)]
or a https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-fu/tree/master/jafu[Java DSL (Jafu)] and lambdas
using functional bean definitions for both Spring Boot infrastructure and application code.

The project also incubates various other features like
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-fu/tree/master/coroutines[Coroutines] or GraalVM support.
You can see https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-fu/blob/master/ROADMAP.adoc[the roadmap] for more details.

It is not intended to be used in production, but rather to incubate and get feedback and contributions
from the community in order to reach a point where its features can be integrated as part of existing
Spring projects like Framework, Boot and Data. The table bellow summarize the status of current features.


== Getting started

=== Via start.spring.io

==== Kofu

 * Create a Spring `2.1.x.RELEASE` project on https://start.spring.io/#!language=kotlin[start.spring.io],
 * Add the `org.springframework.fu:spring-fu-kofu:0.0.3.BUILD-SNAPSHOT` dependency
 * Add the _Reactive Web_ `org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-webflux` dependency 
 * Use latest Kotlin `1.3.x`
 * Modify the generated `*Application.kt` file as following:

```kotlin
package com.example

import org.springframework.fu.kofu.application

val app = application {
	// your application here
	server {
		router {
			GET("/") { ok().syncBody("Hello world!") }
		}
	}
}
fun main() {
	app.run()
}
```

==== Jafu

 * Create a Spring `2.1.x.RELEASE` project on https://start.spring.io/#!language=kotlin[start.spring.io],
 * Add the `org.springframework.fu:spring-fu-jafu:0.0.3.BUILD-SNAPSHOT` dependency
 * Add the _Reactive Web_ `org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-webflux` dependency
 * Modify the generated `*Application.java` file as following:

```java
package com.example;

import static org.springframework.fu.jafu.ApplicationDsl.*;
import static org.springframework.web.reactive.function.server.ServerResponse.*;

import org.springframework.fu.jafu.ApplicationDsl;

public class Application {

	public static ApplicationDsl app = application(app ->
		app.server(server -> server.router(r ->
			r.GET("/", request -> ok().syncBody("Hello world!"))
		))
	);

	public static void main (String[] args) {
		app.run(args);
	}
}
```
